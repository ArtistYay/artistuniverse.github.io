## Understanding the Importance of Client Objectives

Engagements can be complex and bureaucratic, making clear objectives essential for success.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Why set objectives?**
    
    - They create a mutual understanding between the client and the red team.
    - Serve as the foundation for documentation and planning.
    - Help determine the focus and scope of the assessment.
    - Ensure structured execution rather than an unplanned approach.
- **Types of Engagements:**
    
    - **General Internal/Network Penetration Test:** Broad assessment using standard TTPs.
    - **Focused Adversary Emulation:** Targets a specific APT group relevant to the industry.
- **5 Whys Analysis:**
    
    - **Why do we define objectives first?** To align expectations between client and red team.
    - **Why do expectations need alignment?** So both parties know what will be tested and measured.
    - **Why is testing scope crucial?** It prevents unauthorized actions that could disrupt business.
    - **Why prevent disruptions?** To ensure security tests improve resilience without operational risks.
    - **Why is resilience important?** A secure network minimizes the impact of real-world attacks.

##  Defining the Scope of an Engagement

Scope determines what is and isn't allowed during the engagement.

### Scope Components:

- **Client-defined limitations:**
    
    - No exfiltration of real data.
    - Production servers may be off-limits.
    - Specific IP ranges may be in or out of scope.
    - Downtime is prohibited.
- **Why should the client define the scope?**
    
    - They best understand their network and business impact.
    - Protects critical infrastructure from unintended harm.
    - Ensures compliance with legal and operational constraints.
- **Challenges in Scope Definition:**
    
    - Scope may be too restrictive, limiting engagement effectiveness.
    - Red team may need to negotiate exceptions to accurately assess risks.

## Establishing Rules of Engagement (RoE)

RoE is a legally binding document that formalizes client objectives and scope.

### Critical Sections in RoE:

1. **Executive Summary:** High-level overview of engagement and authorization.
2. **Purpose:** Explains why the RoE document exists.
3. **Scope:** Defines permissible actions and constraints.
4. **Rules of Engagement & Support Agreement:** Outlines responsibilities of both parties.
5. **Ground Rules:** Specifies limitations on interactions (e.g., no DDoS attacks).
6. **Resolution of Issues:** Establishes points of contact for conflict resolution.
7. **Authorization & Approval:** Requires signatures to finalize agreement.

- **Why is RoE necessary?**
    - Prevents misunderstandings between the client and red team.
    - Ensures engagement is legally compliant.
    - Defines red team boundaries, preventing excessive risk.

## Campaign Planning and Execution

Using client objectives and RoE, red teams develop structured campaign plans.

### Types of Plans:

1. **Engagement Plan (High-level strategy)**
    
    - Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
    - Resource & personnel requirements
    - Timeline considerations
2. **Operations Plan (Detailed execution strategy)**
    
    - Roles and responsibilities
    - Known information & reconnaissance data
    - Stopping conditions
3. **Mission Plan (Tactical execution)**
    
    - Exact commands & tools to be used
    - Execution timeline
    - Specific operator responsibilities
4. **Remediation Plan (Post-engagement actions)**
    
    - Report summarizing findings
    - Consultation on fixing vulnerabilities

## Concept of Operations (CONOPS)

A high-level document summarizing engagement plans for both business and technical audiences.

### Key CONOPS Elements:

- **Client name & service provider**
- **Timeframe of engagement**
- **General objectives & attack phases**
- **Common tools & techniques**
- **Threat group to emulate (if applicable)**
- **Why is CONOPS important?**
    
    - Helps non-technical stakeholders understand the engagement.
    - Ensures alignment before deep technical planning.
    - Acts as a reference point for refining tactical plans.

- Engagement success depends on **clear communication, structured documentation, and well-defined rules** rather than just technical execution.
- **Pattern recognition**: Engagement planning follows a **structured hierarchy**—Objectives → Scope → RoE → Campaign Plan → Execution → Remediation.
- **Risk reduction**: Every document exists to **minimize operational risk while maximizing security insight**.
- **Thinking critically**: A good red teamer doesn't just execute—**they challenge assumptions, validate scope, and ensure meaningful results**.
