# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to ArtistUniverse Notes

Notes site is currently going through a revamp.

#Welcome to my personal knowledge base â€” a space where I document, explore, and reflect on my journey through **cloud security**, **DevSecOps**, and **security automation**.

#This site serves as a living archive of things I'm learning hands-on â€” from designing secure cloud architectures to building security automations, threat hunting with Microsoft Sentinel, and everything in between.

## ðŸ”­ What Youâ€™ll Find Here

#- **PWNED Labs** â€“ Walkthroughs of offensive and defensive cloud labs
#- **Cloud Security** â€“ Notes on IAM, networking, compute, storage, and more
#- **DevSecOps** â€“ Policy as Code, secure CI/CD, IaC security practices
#- **Microsoft Sentinel** â€“ Detection engineering, KQL queries, Graph API workflows
#- **Experiments** â€“ Homelab setups, alert triaging with GenAI, and beyond

## ðŸš€ Mission

#To become a **mid-level cloud security engineer** with a deep grasp of automation, threat detection, and secure system design â€” while documenting and sharing as I go.
